phase: 05-implementation
traceability:
  design: [DES-I-007]
  requirements: [REQ-NF-REL-003]
purpose: "Quality gate thresholds for CI enforcement (coverage, complexity, duplication)"
coverage:
  minimum: 75.0  # minimum total line coverage percentage
complexity:
  maximum: 10  # max cyclomatic complexity per function
duplications:
  maximum: 3   # max percent duplicated code
security_hotspots:
  maximum: 0   # target security hotspots
code_smells:
  maximum: 0   # target code smells
notes:
  - Rationale: Enforces ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 Phase 05 exit criteria and XP quality gates.
  - Modification: Consolidated duplicate keys; converted to single YAML document.
