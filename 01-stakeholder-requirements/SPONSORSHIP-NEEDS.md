# Sponsorship Needs and Opportunities
## IEEE 1588-2019 PTP Open-Source Implementation

**Document ID**: SPONSORSHIP-001  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-11-07  
**Status**: Active Solicitation  
**Project Type**: 100% Volunteer/Open-Source

---

## 🚨 Critical Context: Volunteer Project

This is a **100% volunteer-driven, open-source project**. All engineering labor is contributed by volunteers in their spare time (evenings, weekends). The project **CAN and WILL proceed without sponsorship**, but external support would significantly accelerate timeline, improve quality, and enable formal certifications.

**License**: Apache 2.0 (maximally permissive for commercial use)  
**Repository**: https://github.com/zarfld/IEEE_1588_2019  
**MVP Target**: 2026-05-14 (26 weeks from kickoff)

---

## 💡 What We're Building

An **open-source, hardware-agnostic, production-quality** implementation of IEEE 1588-2019 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) that:

- Runs on **ARM Cortex-M (embedded)** AND **x86-64 (desktop/server)** from same codebase
- Achieves **sub-microsecond synchronization** using hardware timestamping
- Provides **reference HAL implementations** for Linux, STM32, and community-contributed platforms
- Enables **AVnu Milan, PROFINET, ITU-T G.8275** ecosystems to adopt open timing

**Strategic Positioning**: The **"LWIP of Precision Timing"** - a foundational protocol stack that everyone can build upon, free from vendor lock-in.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can the project succeed without sponsorship?

**A: YES!** This is a volunteer project and will proceed regardless of sponsorship. MVP will be delivered by volunteers in their spare time. Sponsorship **accelerates timeline** and **unlocks enterprise adoption**, but is not required for basic functionality.

### Q: What if we can't afford $10K+ sponsorship?

**A**: Every contribution helps! Even $500 can fund a HAL porting bounty or conference travel. GitHub Sponsors enables recurring small donations. In-kind contributions (hardware, lab access) are equally valuable.

### Q: Do sponsors get to control the project roadmap?

**A: No.** This is an open-source project governed by volunteer maintainers. Sponsors get **input** and **early visibility**, but not **control**. We follow IEEE 1588-2019 specification, not sponsor requests.

### Q: What if the project fails?

**A**: Sponsorship is a **donation to open-source**, not a service contract. We commit to transparency and quarterly reporting, but make no guarantees of delivery timeline or specific features. That said, volunteers are committed and experienced engineers - success is highly likely.

### Q: Can we sponsor specific features?

**A**: Yes, within reason. If your requested feature aligns with IEEE 1588-2019 spec and benefits the community, we can prioritize it. Feature bounties ($2K-$10K) are negotiable for post-MVP enhancements.

### Q: Is sponsorship tax-deductible?

**A**: Depends on your jurisdiction and our legal structure (TBD - may establish 501(c)(3) or fiscal sponsor). Consult your tax advisor. We can provide receipts for sponsorship.
