# Acceptance Test Plan (ATP)
Project: IEEE 1588-2019 PTPv2
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-11-09
Integrity Level: 2
Owners: Customer/Acquirer: TBD, QA Lead: TBD
Status: Draft

## 1. Purpose and Scope
- Validate that the IEEE 1588-2019 protocol implementation meets stakeholder acceptance criteria for compliance, performance, portability, security, usability, and maintainability.
- Out of scope: Hardware/driver-specific timing features; external interoperability events (to be validated in lab and referenced as external evidence).
- Features covered: BMCA, message formats, offset/delay calc, port/clock roles, documentation and CI evidence, no-buffer-overrun checks.

## 5. Acceptance Test Cases (Scenario Format)

ATC-001: BMCA master selection in tie case (P1)
Related: STR-STD-001, STR-STD-003
Given multiple ports with equal priority and class
When BMCA executes selection
Then a deterministic tie-break rule selects a single master
And the chosen clock ID matches expected rule ordering

ATC-002: Reject undersized Sync message (P1)
Related: STR-STD-002, STR-SEC-002
Given a parse request with fewer bytes than minimum header size
When validate_header() runs
Then return INVALID_MESSAGE_SIZE
And no memory access occurs beyond bounds

ATC-003: Offset and delay under jitter (P1)
Related: STR-PERF-001, STR-PERF-004
Given simulated T1..T4 samples with bounded jitter
When compute_offset_and_delay() runs across N>100 samples
Then 95th percentile offset error < configured bound
And delay estimate variance below threshold

ATC-004: Evidence of portability and DI (P1)
Related: STR-PORT-001
Given a compile-only target with mock callbacks
When linked against the concrete library
Then construction and linkage succeed without OS/vendor includes

ATC-005: API docs & getting started (P1)
Related: STR-USE-001, STR-USE-002, STR-MAINT-002, STR-MAINT-004
Given repository root
When scanning headers and README/CI
Then headers contain @file/@brief, README has Getting Started, workflows exist, and CONTRIBUTING is present or warned

ATC-006: Interoperability evidence (P1)
Related: STR-STD-004
Given an external lab report and packet captures against Device X (GM)
When reviewing artifacts
Then interop criteria are met (announce/Sync negotiation, delay handling, role agreement)

ATC-007: Servo convergence (P1)
Related: STR-PERF-003
Given simulated Sync sequence with gradual offset
When servo applies corrections
Then residual error converges below epsilon within M cycles
And remains stable without oscillation beyond threshold

## 6. Procedures (Data, Environment, Steps)
PROC-001: BMCA tie selection

- Data: Deterministic config set included in tests.

PROC-002: Message validation
- Steps: Run `ptp_message_header_validation`, `ptp_message_bodies_validation`.

PROC-003: Offset/Delay
- Steps: Run `offset_calculation_robustness`, `calculate_offset_and_delay`, `delay_resp_processing`.

PROC-004: Portability & DI

## 7. Automation Strategy
- Framework: CTest via CMake; evidence tests as small executables.
- CI: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `ci-standards-compliance.yml`) to run unit + acceptance evidence.
- Data: Deterministic seeds in tests; no flaky network dependencies.
- Flake mitigation: Bounded iterations, timeouts, retry guards in tests.

## 9. Risk, Hazard, and Security Checks
- Abuse cases: malformed packets, buffer underflow/overflow attempts (guarded).
- Privacy: Not applicable (no PII stored); ensure logs don’t leak secrets.
- Hazard: Time skew causing system effects; bounds asserted in offset/delay tests.

## 10. Expected Results and Oracles
- Numeric oracles: offset/delay bounds, deterministic role assignment.
- Structural oracles: header tags, CI files present, README section.
- External oracles: interop report artifacts.

## 11. Entry/Exit Criteria
Entry:
- Stakeholder acceptance criteria enumerated; CI green.
Exit:
- 100% of P1 journeys pass; external interop evidence attached or waived for sprint.

## 12. Documentation Adequacy Check
- README contains Getting Started.
- Public headers include Doxygen markers.
- Tutorials/examples directory present.

## 13. Results and Acceptance Decision
| Test Case | Result | Evidence | Defects |

## 14. Follow-Up Actions
- Implement `servo_convergence_sim` test and tag with `// @satisfies STR-PERF-003`.
- Attach interop report artifacts and update matrix to PASS.
- Enable a CI step to run acceptance evidence targets and publish traceability report.
