# Interoperability Evidence (Placeholder)

This file is a placeholder for interoperability evidence required by **STR-STD-004: Interoperability with Commercial Devices**.

## Planned Artifacts

- Packet captures (pcap) from sessions with reference commercial PTP Grandmaster
- Log excerpts showing successful Sync/Announce exchange and BMCA results
- Offset convergence metrics across devices (Meinberg, Microchip, Oregano)
- Cross-version validation (IEEE 1588-2008 vs 2019 capable peers)

## Next Actions

1. Schedule lab session (Week 2025-11-15)
2. Capture multi-vendor test runs (scripts TBD)
3. Insert anonymized pcaps under `pcaps/` subdirectory
4. Summarize results in this file (PASS/FAIL matrix per vendor)

*Maintains repo traceability; prevents accidental deletion until real evidence is attached.*
